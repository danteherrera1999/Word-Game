# Word-Game

This is a web game I built for learning languages (specifically for portuguese in my case but with support for other langueges). It ran on the LAMP stack within a digital ocean droplet. The backend was primarily in PHP and mySQL for serving a daily wordset for users to match translations between. I took down the droplet as it was getting a bit expensive to host, but I will modify the code in the future to run from my github pages repo. It wont have the same dynamic properties that the LAMP one had, but i'll be able to host it for free :)
