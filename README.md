# Word-Game

This is a web game I built for learning languages (specifically for portuguese in my case but with support for other langueges). It ran on the LAMP stack within a digital ocean droplet. The backend was primarily in PHP and mySQL for serving a daily wordset for users to match translations between. I took down the droplet as it was getting a bit expensive to host, but I have uploaded a static version on my website [Here](https://danteherrera.com/word_match/word_match.html). It doesn't have the all the same functionality as the LAMP version, but i can host it for free :)
